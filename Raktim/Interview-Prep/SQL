10. BLOB Data type ---->> Large object holding huge data
11. Retrieving data in sorted order from the table ---> Order By clause 
    select * from table order by columnName desc 
12. Creating a  view : create view viewname as select * from tablename where column_name like 'a%';

    select * from table where column_name like 'a%' limit 2 ; //it will retrieve top 2 records 
14. Difference between WHERE & HAVING clause : 
    Having should be used when we will be using group by 
    select * from tablenam1 inner join tablenam2 on tablenam1.col1 = tablenam2.col2 groupby tablenam1.col1 having tablenam1.col1 <100 ;
15. Find second largest salary from table:
    Name     Salary
---------------
abc     100000
bcd     1000000

        select e.Name , MAX(e.Salary) from Employee as e    //will fetch bcd     1000000
Query2: Find the second largest salary from the above table
        select e.Name,MAX(e.Salary) from Employee e where e.Salary < (select MAX(e.Salary) from Employee e);

16. Drop table table_name -> will remove the table

    CHECK
    
CREATE TABLE tablename(employee varchar(255), ID int , NOT NULL(ID) );    
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
