SDET POCs

1. Docker integration with selenium grid.Executing the selenium automation test cases
In multiple docker containers by the following -
i.create a docker-compose.yaml file and passing the knowledge of selenium hub & nodes 
Inside the .yaml file. 
ii. Once running the docker-compose , the entire selenium grid will be up & running 
Inside the containers. 
iii. Now route the automation test cases inside those containers as a distributon test.
iv. Configure it in TestNG and run the parallel tests.
v. Integrate docker in a ci/cd tool like  Jenkins. 

Flow:
Write a .bat file and mention docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml inside the file
-->trigger the .bat file by writing a java code with Runtime class-->scan the output file 
Where the server log will be displayed check whether the grid is up & running
--> once the grid is up , trigger the automation test cases inside the containers. 
-->integrate docker tests with maven & Jenkins !!

Framework
   i. Create API project in SOAP UI tool from functional document using method   End Point URL    Resource  Parameter
   ii. Develop a Test Suite <Test Case <<test steps (REST) from the services of third API project
   iii. Add some assertions to make the test case robust like-property content assertion , Script Assertion
        example: In the addTestcase-> from the JSON response grab the ID (property) value and paste it into the TestSuite level as 'propert transfer'
        Now, this ID porperty value is accessible by all the other test cases since it is available in Test Suite level
        Then, in the next test case in the 'requestJSON' add ${#TestSuite#ID}
   iv.   Create a java project and import all the SOAP UI jars from lib/bin  soapui5.3.0 ->> bin dir
    vi. Create WsdlProject project = new WsdlProject("SOAPUI project path");
               WsdlTestSuite testsuite = project.getTestSuiteByName("TestSuiteName");
                           //execute the test case code here
   vii. Execute the test
   viii. Integrate TestNG and trigger testes from testNG.xml
   ix.For execution purpose ->> create one folder called lib inside your project path and add all the jars obver that folder
      javac -classpath lib/* -d ./bin ./src/Rest/*.java
      java -cp bin;lib/* org.testng.TestNG testng.xml
   x. Run the jenkins server : java -jar jenkins.war -hhtpPort = 9090
      job set up schedule : minutes(0-59)   hour(0-23)  day-month(1-31)  month(1-12) day(1-7)
