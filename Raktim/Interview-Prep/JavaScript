Javascript

Html/css  for attractive
Javascript for interactive
Angualar, React - these are frontend frameworks to execute javascript 
node.js --> backend environment (server side)

When we write code in javascript -> browser interprets /converts into machine code i.e. 
Browser engine(e.g. V8 from chrome) converts the JS code into machine code 

//Node.js
Node.js is a runtime environment which helps javascript to execute on a stand alone machine
It's a engine which runs javascript on a physical machine.
Now, when the HTTP components gets added with node.js, it helps javascript running on server as well.

So, Node.js is a runtime environment which uses the V8 engine to execute javascript !!

//NPM (Non package Manager)
These are like the dependencies which will give all packages/modules to build the 
application in javascript





i. Javascript is a client side language or browser side language.It is running inside browser
Clicking button, filling form ---->> all these are from javascript (coming from browser)

ii. Every browser implements one javascript engine. For chrome it's V8(written by google in C++)

iii. On based on engine, they created node.js which is a server (node.js is running on server)

iv. Add index.html inside 'VS editor' --> !ENTER --> Install plugin 'LIVE SERVER' --> right click and
  --> open with live server --> app will be up & running

console.log(language.length);
language[1] = 'C'; //updating 1st index
