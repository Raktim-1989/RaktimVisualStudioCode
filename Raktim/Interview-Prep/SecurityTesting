### SECURITY TESTING ###

     Security is necessary for everything. If there is any security leakege, it allows hackers to hack webapplication / webservice.

1. SQL Injection    
    We can check whether SQL Injection having any leakage or not, SOAP UI tool does for us. 

2. XPATH Injection
    Hackers can hack data from the XML Path consruction //div[@class = pass] 
    We need to test whether there is any leakage in xpath construction
  
3. Fuzzing Scan
    Puting random data as input as part of this Fuzzing Scan testing
4. Invalid Types
    Malformed XML : By sending malformed xml to targett server, our server may get crashed. 
    We need to test whether our server is responding with these malformed xml or not.   
5. Boundary Scan
6. XML BOMB 
7. Cross Site scripting : It is called XSS scripting, probably the most common website security 
                          vulnerability. It enables an attacker to inject client side script (javascript)
                          into webpages viewed by other user !!
                          It is almost same as XPATH INJECTION & SQL INJECTION but here the target
                          is user of a website instead of website .
